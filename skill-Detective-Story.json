As evening turns into night, the magnesium flares, which will commemorate the opening of the Clifton Suspension bridge, are being lit. You stand near the center of the bridge during the ceremony, a front row spot, which you got from Lord Elroy Grey, a prominent member of the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers. The reason for your attendance and why you have such an upper class spot, is that you are a private detective hired by the society to observe the members of the bridge's trust. Someone in the charitable trust, originally set up by the society, is suspected of stealing funds for personal use, and your job is to discover the veracity of that suspicion and the culprit, should the suspicion be true.\n\n<audio src=\"soundbank://soundlibrary/weather/wind/wind_01\"/>\n\nAs you continue to observe the trust members for any signs of guilt and suspicion, suddenly a strong gust of wind blows out the magnesium flares, returning the entire event to the darkness of night. In the darkness you lose sight of the six trust members and resign yourself to wait it out. \n\n<audio src=\"soundbank://soundlibrary/explosions/fire/fire_07\"/>\n\nAfter 10 minutes the flares are lit again and you can see once more, immediately taking the opportunity to lock onto the trust members again. However you and the trust's members begin to notice something strange, one of them is missing. Henry Deadman, a successful Bristol business man appears to be gone. \n\n<audio src=\"soundbank://soundlibrary/voices/crowds/crowds_12\"/>\n\nYou decide to look around for where he could be, pondering why he would suddenly leave the venue, but soon gasps are heard from the crowd as a group of men carrying a body approach the bridge. The body is none other than that of Henry Deadman. The men explain that they were watching the unveiling of the bridge from the gorge it spans when they heard something hit the ground near them. They quickly investigated and found that it was a dead body. They realized that the man must have fallen from the bridge, a thing, which even with the lack of light, would have been improbable. Unless of course he was pushed. The crowd seems to quickly reach the same conclusion, and before long the death has been declared a murder. But if he really was pushed off the bridge, the only one in a position to do so would have been the other members of the trust. The members seem to realize this as well and are beginning to cast glances of suspicion at each other. Before this gets out of hand, you decide to introduce yourself and resolve this mystery. You are a detective after all.\n"
