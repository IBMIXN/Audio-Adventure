Project Overview:

The purpose of the game is to solve social isolation (particularly for the elderly) causing acute problems relating to health,
both mental and physical, it requires an engaging activity, that brings joy while also exercising the mind.
The game can be interacted with via verbal commands to take our users on an engaging and enjoyable but also challenging experience.

The playtime will be around 10 ~ 15 minute. It has a linear storyline with multiple choices that may lead to a bad end, and puzzles to be solved. 
There will be interactions with AI NPCs that react differently depending on the player's emotional response.
It is situated in real parts of Bristol (local landmarks, areas of interest) and perhaps build on local knowledge that long time Bristolians would be aware of.

The game utilizes Watson Assistant (which incorporates Natural Language Understanding) and Tone Analyser (to determine emotional responses).
It also uses Alexa skill, so that those at home can enjoy it without the need to download, configure and setup.
