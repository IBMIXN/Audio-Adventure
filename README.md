In this day and age, technology advances faster than ever, but it creates a gap between the older and the younger generations. This results in social isolation between one another, which only worsens due to the recent pandemic and lockdowns. Our client Jon Mc Namara, who is an IBM employee, came up with this project to hopefully resolve this issue.

The purpose of the game is to solve social isolation (particularly for the elderly) causing acute problems relating to health, both mental and physical, it requires an engaging activity that brings joy while also exercising the mind. The game can be interacted via verbal commands to take our users on an engaging and enjoyable but also challenging experience.

The game is a storytelling game that revolves around a linear storyline with multiple choices that may lead to bad ends, and puzzles to be solved. There will be interactions with AI NPCs that react differently depending on the player's emotional response. For the player to advance through the game, he or she has to pick the correct response under different circumstances. The story's setting is situated in real parts of Bristol (local landmarks, areas of interest) and builds on local knowledge that long-time Bristolians would be aware of. This enables the player to explore the city without the need to go outdoors.

The game utilizes Watson Assistant (which incorporates Natural Language Understanding) and Tone Analyser (to determine emotional responses). It also uses Alexa skill (transfers player's spoken words into strings), so that those at home can enjoy it without the need to download, configure and setup.
